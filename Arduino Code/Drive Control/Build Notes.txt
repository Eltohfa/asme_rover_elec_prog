11/26:
- Probably going to need to create a new PPM library
  - Methods:
    - Utilize a timer interrupt to keep CPU from being bound up, for a given speed the timer interrupt may need rewriting but the time between pulses will remain constant
    - Utilize existing PWM library and trigger a latch on falling edges (slower but may be easier to follow)
- Need to finalize radio type so that code can be written
- Need to choose chips for reading voltage and current at critical locations
- Need to push diagrams to repository
